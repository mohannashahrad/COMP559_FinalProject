# COMP559_FinalProject
My final project for the COMP559 (Computer Animations) of McGill University

To get started with the code, please follow the following steps: (Similar to the way we did for assignments throughout the semester)

1. Make sure you have GLM installed. If not get the source code from [here](http://glm.g-truc.net/).
2. Set up an environemnt variable `THIRDPARTY_DIR` pointing to the `/path/to/THIRDPARTY_DIR` provided. 
3. Craete an environment variable `GLM_INCLUDE_DIR` pointing to `/path/to/GLM`.
4. Set up a build directory and change directory into it: mkdir build && cd build
5. Run `cmake ..` for the Makefile to get created.
6. Run `make -j4`
7. Run `./COMP559Project ../resources/`

## NOTE
As parts of my project is from the template used for assignments, I will make sure to make this repository private after the project reviewing process is finished.
